  <p class="h2subheading">— Using Open With To Edit Files —</p>

  <p>Sigil is a powerful editor but it can’t edit images and it may not have some of the features you use in other editors. In these cases you can edit the file in an external program – and when you save, Sigil will immediately update its copy. This is very useful if you want to quickly edit images or want to edit CSS stylesheets and immediately see how changes affect the layout of your book.</p>

  <p>To edit a file externally, right-click on the file’s name in the Book Browser and choose <span class="menuitem">Open With</span> from the context menu (you can also right-click on an image in Book View):</p>

  <div class="image"><img alt="external-open-with" src="../Images/external-open-with.png" /></div>

  <p>When you open a file you first need to choose the application to use with that file type. Each file type (html, image, stylesheet) can use a different application.</p>

  <p>You can then give the application a friendly name that will be used in the menu the next time you use <span class="menuitem">Open With</span>:</p>

  <div class="image"><img alt="external-open-name" src="../Images/external-open-name.png" /></div>

  <p>When you next use <span class="menuitem">Open With</span> on the file you will see the friendly name you gave the application, and the option to choose a different application. Only one default application will be listed but you can change it at any time:</p>

  <div class="image"><img alt="external-open-with-name" src="../Images/external-open-with-name.png" /></div>

  <div class="tip">
    <p class="tiptext">If you make changes to the file in Sigil while the file is being edited in another program then you may lose data. You should always open the file for editing externally, make the changes, then save and close the file in the external application before making any changes to that file in Sigil.</p>

    <p class="tiptext">In some cases images may not update properly in Book View, especially if Preview is open. You may need to switch to Code View and back or close and re-open the file to see the edited image.</p>
