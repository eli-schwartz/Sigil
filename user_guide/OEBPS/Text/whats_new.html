  <h2 id="whats_new">What’s New</h2>

  <p>The latest versions of Sigil contain hundreds of changes, bug fixes and new features while still retaining the same easy to use interface of earlier versions. Almost all of Sigil’s code has been updated and improved with particular focus on the following areas:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><span class="listheading">Stability:</span> All known crashes and related bugs from previous versions have been identified and fixed – making Sigil completely stable for updating your EPUBs.</li>

    <li><span class="listheading">Robustness:</span> Sigil can correct even more common problems when reading files, and will no longer exit when opening invalid EPUBs. Saving has been enhanced to perform more integrity checks. Splits and merges can now be done exactly where you want without potential data loss. The cursor position is correctly updated when you switch views, and Find &amp; Replaces work consistently and accurately over one or all files.</li>

    <li><span class="listheading">Performance:</span> Sigil is now significantly faster in many areas: opening and changing tabs, generating a TOC, merging files, bulk renaming, replacing text, etc.</li>

    <li><span class="listheading">Flexibility:</span> More preferences, options and features were added to let you use Sigil the way you want.</li>
  </ul>
