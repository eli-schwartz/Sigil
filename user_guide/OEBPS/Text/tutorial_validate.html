  <h2 id="tutorial_check_book">Check For Errors In Your EPUB</h2>

  <p>Your book is almost ready. You just need to check your EPUB to see if there are any issues that might cause problems for ereaders. This can range from missing or extra files, or broken links, etc. This may be unlikely for your first file, but itâ€™s good practice to do the checks to help make sure your EPUB complies to the standard.</p>

  <p>To check or validate your book, use the Validate EPUB With FlightCrew button <img alt="document-validate_22px" src="../Images/document-validate_22px.png" />. This will open a window just below your document and list any problems that were found. For instance, if you forgot to enter the Title of the book in the Metadata Editor you might see:</p>

  <div class="image"><img alt="" src="../Images/tutorial_validate_results.png" /></div>

  <p>It can be difficult to interpret exactly what the issues are sometimes, but you should read through them to see if there is anything that you recognise and can fix. Pink lines are errors that must be fixed, and yellow lines are warnings that should be fixed,</p>

  <p>Details on the messages are available in the <a href="../Text/validation.html">Validation</a> chapter.</p>

  <p>Once you have fixed all the issues, Validate will confirm everything is okay:</p>

  <div class="image"><img alt="" src="../Images/tutorial_validate_no_problems.png" /></div>

  <p>Now just save <img alt="button-save" src="../Images/button-save.png" /> your EPUB and you are done!</p>
