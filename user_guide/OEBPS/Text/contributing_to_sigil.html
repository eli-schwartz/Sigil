  <p class="h2subheading">— Helping Development —</p>

  <p>Sigil is completely free and open-source software, and it is developed and supported entirely by volunteers who love books and want well-edited ebooks to be easily available. Your entirely optional contributions can help improve Sigil and show your appreciation for making the software available. Feel free to just say hi on the Sigil forum and let others know how useful Sigil is to you.</p>

  <h3 class="sigil_not_in_toc" id="translating">Translating Sigil</h3>

  <p>Translating Sigil into other languages is highly encouraged. There is an active community of volunteers who translate Sigil already, and new languages can always be added.</p>

  <p>The best way to translate Sigil is to use the web based translation system provided by Transifex. Translations done using Transifex are downloaded just before releasing a new version:</p>

  <ul>
    <li class="indent"><a href="http://www.transifex.net/projects/p/sigil/">Sigil translations @ Transifex</a></li>
  </ul>

  <p>Alternatively you can use local Desktop tools for translation. Sigil uses Qt’s Linguist tool for creating and editing translations. You can either download Qt and compile the tools manually or use the pre-built packages:</p>

  <ul>
    <li class="indent"><a href="http://code.google.com/p/photivo/downloads/detail?name=translator-tools-win32.zip">Pre-built Translation tools</a></li>
  </ul>

  <p>Updating and creating new translation files using the Desktop tools is the same process:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Open a terminal and change to the <span class="example">src/Sigil/Resource_Files/ts</span> directory. This holds all of the raw translation files.</li>

    <li>Run <span class="example">lupdate ../../ * -ts out.ts</span> to either generate a new translation file or to update an existing one with any new strings that have been added.</li>

    <li>Use Linguist to write translations for the strings in a given ts file.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>All translations files should have the form <span class="example">sigil_lang.ts</span>. Where lang is a two letter language code. For example the Polish translation will have the filename <span class="example">sigil_pl.ts</span>.</p>
