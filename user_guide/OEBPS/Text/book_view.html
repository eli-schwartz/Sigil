  <p class="h2subheading">— WYSIWYG Editing —</p>

  <p>Book View (or WYSIWYG mode – what you see is what you get) is one of two ways you can edit your book in Sigil. Book View is how most people edit their book when they start to use Sigil since it is the closest to a standard word processor. Its a good way to make basic changes to your book when you aren’t too concerned about the underlying HTML code. However, when you want more control over the format of your EPUB or to use Sigil’s advanced features then you can use Code View.</p>

  <div class="tip">
    <p class="tiptext">Book View is only an approximation of what your book will look like – you need to test your book on your target ereaders.</p>
  </div>

  <p>Switch to Book View by clicking the Book View button <img alt="" src="../Images/view-book_22px.png" />, selecting the menu item <span class="menuitem">View→Book View</span> or its keyboard shortcut:</p>

  <div class="image"><img alt="" src="../Images/book-view.png" /></div>

  <p>As you can see, the text and images are displayed on the screen as they would be on your ereader. You can edit, delete or add any text you want in the editor.</p>

  <p>When you apply formatting in Book View, Sigil will do its best to apply the formatting you intended. However, in some cases it may not look exactly as you want. You can undo the change, and then try to re-format the text. But if you want to make sure the formatting is exactly the way you want it, you will need to use Code View. You can switch between Book View and Code View at any time since they are just two views of the same page. Your current paragraph position will be remembered.</p>

  <div class="tip">
    <p class="tiptext">You can toggle between Book View and Code View by using the keyboard shortcut <span class="shortcut">F2</span> or by double-clicking on the current tab’s name.</p>
  </div>

  <p>Certain features in Sigil are only available in Code View. For instance Spellchecking and the Search Editor can only be used in Code View, and Find &amp; Replace will automatically switch you to Code View if you try to replace text, or do a find across all HTML files.</p>
