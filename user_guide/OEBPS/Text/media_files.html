  <h2 id="images">Images, Video, Audio</h2>

  <p class="h2subheading">— Inserting Media Files into your book —</p>

  <p>You can insert any image, video, or audio file into your book clicking the Insert File button <img alt="" src="../Images/insert-image_22px.png" /> or selecting the menu item <span class="menuitem">Insert→File or its shortcut</span>. If the file has not already been added to your EPUB, you can select it from your computer.</p>

  <div class="tip">
    <p class="tiptext">EPUB 2 and most e-ink readers only support images, but the ability to insert video and audio is available if needed.</p>
  </div>

  <p>When you insert a media file into your book, it is first added to the EPUB and then a link to it is created. This allows you to add a file once and then link to it many times, or to add lots of files at one time and then later create links to them.</p>

  <h3 class="sigil_not_in_toc">Adding Media Files to Your EPUB</h3>

  <p>You can add image, video, or audio files to your book in several ways:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Click the Add Existing Files button <img alt="" src="../Images/document-add_22px.png" />.</li>

    <li>Select the menu item <span class="menuitem">File→Add→Existing Files.</span></li>

    <li>Right-click on a file in the Book Browser and select <span class="menuitem">Add Existing Files.</span></li>
  </ul>

  <div>
    All of these will display a standard file dialog allowing you to select one or more files from your computer. Select as many media files as you want. If any of the files already exists in the book, you will be prompted to confirm if you want to replace them.
  </div>

  <p>The files will be added to the appropriate folder in the Book Browser based on their file extension. However, they are not yet actually used anywhere in your book – they are just available to use. To use them, you need to link to or insert them in your book.</p>

  <p>You can actually add files to your book and insert them in one step:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><span class="menuitem">Click the Insert File button</span> <img alt="" src="../Images/insert-image_22px.png" /> and then click on <span class="buttonbox">Other Files</span>.</li>

    <li>Right-click in your document in Book View and select <span class="menuitem">Insert File</span> and then click on <span class="buttonbox">Other Files</span>.</li>

    <li>Select the menu item <span class="menuitem">Insert→File</span> and then click on <span class="buttonbox">Other Files</span>.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 class="sigil_not_in_toc" id="inserting_images">Inserting Files Into Your Book</h3>

  <p>To insert an image, video, or audio file into your book click on the location in your file where you want the image to be located (in either Book View or Code View). Then click the Insert File button <img alt="" src="../Images/insert-image_22px.png" />:</p>

  <div class="image"><img alt="insert-file-main" src="../Images/insert-file-main.png" /></div>

  <p>A list of the files in your book is displayed. Select one or more files to insert and click <span class="buttonbox">OK,</span> or double-click on the file you want in order to select and insert it automatically.</p>

  <div class="tip">
    <p class="tiptext">You can choose files from your computer instead of from the EPUB by clicking on the <span class="buttonbox">Other Files</span> button. Files will be added to your book and then inserted automatically.</p>
  </div>

  <p>You can filter which files are shown by selecting the type of file on the left, or entering part of the filename in the Filter text box.</p>

  <p>You can enable thumbnails for images in the Insert File dialog by clicking on the zoom buttons <img alt="" src="../Images/thumbnail%2B-.png" /> on the lower left to choose the size of the thumbnails. The dialog is slower with thumbnails so you can remove them by making them smaller until they are gone.</p>

  <div class="image"><img alt="insert-file-thumbnails" src="../Images/insert-file-thumbnails.png" /></div>

  <div class="tip">
    <p class="tiptext">You can also right-click in Book View where you want the image and choose <span class="menuitem">Insert File</span> from the context menu.</p>
  </div>

  <h3 class="sigil_not_in_toc">View File Details</h3>

  <p>To view details for an image, video or audio file double-click on its filename in the Book Browser or right-click on it in Book View and select <span class="menuitem">Open Tab For…</span>.</p>

  <p>For an image, the Width and Height in pixels, size of the file in kilobytes, and whether or not the image has any color defined are shown:</p>

  <div class="image"><img alt="" src="../Images/image_tab_example.png" /></div>

  <h3 class="sigil_not_in_toc">Editing Media Files</h3>

  <p>Sigil allows you to easily edit an image, video, or audio file once it is in your EPUB.</p>

  <p>Simply right-click on the image in Book View, or right-click on its filename in the Book Browser, and select the menu item <span class="menuitem">Open With</span>. This will open the file in the external editor of your choice.</p>

  <p>See the <a href="../Text/external_editors.html">External Editors</a> chapter for details.</p>

  <h3 class="sigil_not_in_toc">Deleting Unused Media Files</h3>

  <p>You can select the menu item <span class="menuitem">Tools→Delete Unused Media Files</span> to automatically delete any unused image, video, or audio files. Sigil will present you a list of files that do not have any links to them from your HTML or CSS files and then allow you to confirm which files to delete – or to cancel deleting them.</p>

  <div class="image"><img alt="image-delete-unused" src="../Images/image-delete-unused.png" /></div>

  <p>For more control over deleting individual files, you can use a report to view the number of times a file is used and then delete the ones you want – see the <a href="../Text/reports.html">Reports</a> chapter.</p>

  <div class="tip">
    <p class="tiptext">You can double-click on a file to show that file in a tab.</p>
  </div>

  <h3 class="sigil_not_in_toc" id="cover_images">Cover Images</h3>

  <p>You can quickly add a cover image using <a href="../Text/add_cover.html">Add Cover</a>.</p>

  <p>But if you want to add a cover manually, then be aware that images for covers are special in that you must tell the EPUB which image should be used for the cover. Different ereaders use different methods to identify the cover, so you should use both methods:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Create a <span class="example">cover.html</span> file at the start of your book and then insert your image into it.</li>

    <li>Mark the <span class="example">cover.html</span> file as a cover file by right-clicking on it in the Book Browser Text folder, selecting <span class="menuitem">Add Semantics</span> and choosing <span class="menuitem">Cover</span>.</li>

    <li>Mark your actual cover image file as a Cover by right-clicking on it’s file in the Book Browser Images folder, selecting <span class="menuitem">Add Semantics</span> and choosing <span class="menuitem">Cover</span>.</li>
  </ul>

    <p class="tiptext">Please make sure you have permission to use any images in your book as most images are copyrighted and their use may require a license.</p>
